# PWM Analysis

Testing and analysis tools for PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) modules.

## Subdirectories

- `bpwm/` - Bipolar PWM analysis tools
- `epwm/` - Enhanced PWM analysis tools

## Purpose

This directory contains analysis tools for validating PWM module implementations against theoretical models and performance requirements.

Future tools may include:
- PWM waveform analysis
- Duty cycle accuracy testing
- Frequency response validation
- Switching timing analysis
