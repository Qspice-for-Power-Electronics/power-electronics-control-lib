# Enhanced PWM Analysis

Analysis tools for Enhanced PWM (EPWM) modules.

## Purpose

This directory will contain testing and analysis tools for enhanced PWM modules, including:
- Advanced PWM waveform analysis
- Dead-time accuracy testing
- Phase synchronization validation
- High-frequency switching analysis

## Future Development

Analysis tools will be added here as the EPWM module testing requirements are defined.
