# Bipolar PWM Analysis

Analysis tools for Bipolar PWM (BPWM) modules.

## Purpose

This directory will contain testing and analysis tools for bipolar PWM modules, including:
- PWM waveform analysis
- Duty cycle accuracy testing
- Switching performance validation
- Frequency response analysis

## Future Development

Analysis tools will be added here as the BPWM module testing requirements are defined.
